# for tensorflow:
The first required installation is Phiflow. The old installation I was using before break (simply !pip install --ugrade --quiet phiflow) was no longer working. 
Under 'issues' on the phiflow GitHub, it seems other people are having the same issue = [Import Error: Cannot import name 'getitem_dataclass'](https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow/issues/184). 
The current, temporary solution is below, and is the first installation package for this code:

!pip uninstall phiflow
!pip install git+https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiFlow@develop
!pip uninstall phiml
!pip install git+https://github.com/tum-pbs/PhiML@develop

# for pytorch:
!pip install torch

Below are the remaining requirements for the entirety of this code:

SETUP
-----
# tensorflow:

from phi.tf.flow import * 

# torch:

import os
os.environ['PHIFLOW_BACKEND'] = 'torch'  # before importing PhiFlow

from phi.flow import *

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# both tensorflow and pytorch requirements:

import numpy as np

VISUALIZATIONS
--------------
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
from IPython.display import display, HTML

TRAINING
--------
import time
